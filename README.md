# Sitejabber

This is a basic integration to Sitejabber's API.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'sitejabber'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install sitejabber

## Configuration

There are a few settings that have to be set globally:

```ruby
# In Rails, you could put this in config/initializers/sitejabber.rb
Sitejabber.redis = ConnectionPool.new { Redis.new( url: REDIS_URL ) }

# Required
Sitejabber.api_key = MY_API_KEY
Sitejabber.api_email = MY_API_EMAIL
Sitejabber.api_password = MY_API_PASSWORD

# Optional
Sitejabber.default_domain = MY_DEFAULT_DOMAIN # ex: github.com
```

**Note Important Note:** This gem requires Redis to work. It uses a Redis server to store access tokens.

## Usage

### Reviews

If you set your domain globally, you can do:

```ruby
Sitejabber::Review.new.create(
  first_name: 'John',
  last_name: 'Doe',
  email: 'foo@bar.com',
  title: 'This is awesome!!!',
  rating: '5',
  content: 'Fell in love first week of owning.',
  order_id: 'ABC123'  
)

# Check Sitejabber API docs for required and optional parameters.
```

You can also specify your domain by review, for example:

```ruby
Sitejabber::Review.new("github.com").create(
  first_name: 'John',
  last_name: 'Doe',
  email: 'foo@bar.com',
  title: 'This is awesome!!!',
  rating: '5',
  content: 'Fell in love first week of owning.',
  order_id: 'ABC123'  
)

# Check Sitejabber API docs for required and optional parameters.
```
